Primary Goal
1- Adding 1000 Particle at random Position
	A-) Particle is made of four vertices of Rectangle
	B-) Mapped the Texture Coordinate
	
2- Animation : Constantly increase the size of Particle and swapping the texture 
	A-) Increasing Y-Component of position of every particles on every rendering tick
	B-) Life of Particles increse on every rendering tick
	C-) Particle destroyed on crossing life spam of 1.25 sec
	D-) Particle has fire texture upto 1.0sec after that smoke texture

3- Load Two Textures : During Rendering of Particles, swapping the texture


Secondary Goal
1- Spawning and Destroying
	A-) Random number of particles are added in the particle pool
	B-) If particle count goes below 100, more particles add in pool
	C-) Life of every particle is 1.25sec after that it destroyed
